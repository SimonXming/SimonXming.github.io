### As `Nicholas Coghlan(CPython core developer)` says:

> There are a couple of very, very scary things in this world.

> The first is a bored human. Bored humans have time to indulge their curiosity, with potentially amazing results.

> The second is a lazy human. Lazy humans can be quite inventive when it comes to figuring out how to do less work.

> So, here's to boredom & laziness - two of the prime movers in human progress!
